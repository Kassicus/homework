## Search Filters Functionality Fix

### Root Cause Analysis
- Identified parameter mismatch between form field names and backend route handlers
- Contracts route was looking for `client_id` parameter but form was sending `client`
- Clients route was not handling advanced search filters at all
- JavaScript form interception was not affecting universal search component (different form IDs)

### Parameter Mapping Corrections
- **Contracts Route**: Fixed parameter name from `client_id` to `client` to match form field
- **Clients Route**: Added comprehensive filter handling for search type, status, and organization
- **Template Integration**: Updated both routes to pass filter parameters back to templates
- **Debug Logging**: Added parameter logging to help troubleshoot search issues

## Clear Filters Button Functionality Fix

### Root Cause Analysis
- Clear filters button visibility logic only checked for a subset of available filter parameters

- Search input clear button (X button) had no click handler functionality
- Advanced search clear button was calling non-existent JavaScript function

### Clear Button Visibility Fix
- **Parameter Detection**: Extended visibility check to include all filter parameters
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Added checks for `client`, `contract_type`, `type`, `organization`, `expiring_soon`
- **Dynamic Display**: Clear button now appears when any filter parameter is active
- **Template Logic**: Updated universal search component condition logic

### JavaScript Function Implementation
- **clearAdvancedSearch()**: Added function to clear all advanced search filters while preserving main search query
- **exportResults()**: Added placeholder function for future export functionality  
- **initializeClearButtons()**: Added function to handle search input clear button (X)
- **Form Submission**: Clear functions properly submit form to apply cleared state

### Clear Button Functionality Types
- **Search Input Clear**: X button next to search input clears only the search term
- **Advanced Filters Clear**: "Clear Filters" button in advanced section clears all filters except search term
- **Complete Clear**: "Clear Search" button in results summary clears all parameters including search term

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: Clear buttons work instantly with form submission
- **Selective Clearing**: Users can clear just search term or just advanced filters
- **Visual Consistency**: All clear buttons follow the same interaction pattern
- **Proper Reset**: Cleared forms return to default state with all filters removed

### Technical Implementation Details

## Admin Table Container Padding Fix

### Problem Identification
- **Issue**: Admin tables (Activity Log, System Users, Admin Contracts) had no spacing around the table container
- **Root Cause**: Admin templates used `<div class="card-body p-0">` removing Bootstrap's default padding

- **Visual Result**: Proper breathing room between table and card borders
- **Professional Appearance**: Consistent spacing matches contracts/clients table presentation

### Cleanup Actions
